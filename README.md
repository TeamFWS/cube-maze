# ðŸŽ² CubeMaze  
VR puzzle game for Oculus Quest where players guide a ball through procedurally generated 3D mazes inside a rotating cube. Built in Unity with Meta XR SDK, featuring interactive traps, keys, and multiplayer challenges.  

## Overview  
**CubeMaze** is a **VR puzzle game** developed for **Oculus Quest (1, 2, and 3)**.  
The game blends classic labyrinth mechanics with modern VR interaction: the player must guide a ball through a maze hidden inside a rotating cube, avoiding traps and collecting keys to unlock passages.  

The project demonstrates the use of **procedural content generation**, **VR interaction systems**, and **immersive audiovisual design**. In addition to single-player gameplay, CubeMaze includes a **multiplayer challenge mode**, where players compete for the best time in passing the maze.  

## Key Features  
- **Procedural maze generation** using depth-first search (DFS) algorithm, ensuring unique solvable puzzles.  
- **VR interaction mechanics** â€“ tilt and rotate the cube using Oculus Quest controllers.  
- **Interactive obstacles**:  
  - Locked doors and collectible keys.  
  - Retractable spike traps.  
- **Multiplayer mode** â€“ competitive runs with shared results in a ranking system.  
- **Progression system** â€“ save and review times and reattempt past puzzles.  
- **Immersive environments** â€“ multiple VR scenes (e.g. tropical island, lunar station) and an AR mode with transparent surroundings.  
- **Audiovisual feedback** â€“ background music, sound effects for collisions, traps, and keys, and controller haptics tied to gameplay events.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Unity Engine (C#)** â€“ core development and scripting.  
- **Meta XR All-in-One SDK** (Core, Interaction, Haptics, Audio, Voice, Platform).  
- **Meta Building Blocks** (Passthrough, Controller Tracking, Hand Tracking, Ray Interaction, Virtual Hands/Keyboard).  

## Skills Demonstrated  
- **Procedural generation** of 3D mazes with algorithmic placement of interactive elements.  
- Development for **VR platforms (Oculus Quest)** including controller tracking, passthrough, and haptic feedback.  
- Design of **multiplayer ranking systems** and local leaderboards.  
- Building immersive **UI systems** in VR, integrated into the game world (cube-based UI panels).  
- **Scene design & optimization** for multiple VR/AR environments.  
- Full-cycle **XR development workflow**, including testing on real hardware and using XR simulators.
